IComm is our project for [Lixiang Cup Data Contest of China Telecom](http://hezuo.sh.189.cn/content.aspx?id=461). China Telecom has provided more than 30T data of mobile and wire-network to explore. Our team focus on the community commerce in modern cities.

Cities are big but the money are limited. Investors are always confusing that where to exploit their next market: a convenient store near the subway or a restaurant next to a office building. Our project is the bridge between the demand and the city itself. Through mining the telecom data, we obtain the distribution of the people flow. We classify the city into working and living areas based on the people's behaviors. Also, we extract the area ideas from the network flow for better understanding the demand of the people in the area. Along with the facilities nearby, the investors will have a clear understanding of the demand of the people.
